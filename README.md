# Visualisation-tool
 Bubble sort visualization has been implemented using graphics.h library. As we all know that bubble sort swaps the adjacent elements if they are unsorted and finally the larger one being shifted towards to the end of array in each pass. Sometimes, it becomes difficult to analyze the data manually, but after plotting graphically it is much easier to understand
 Pre-defined Functions Used:

setcurrentwindow():A function which is used to set the size of current window.
setcolor(n): A function which is used to change the color of cursor by changing the value of n.
delay(n): A function which is used to delay the program by n milliseconds. It is being used for slowing down the transitions speed
line(x1, y1, x2, y2): A function which is used to draw an line from point (x1, y1) to point (x2, y2). (0, 0) being the left top corner of the screen and b
ottom right be (n1, n2) where n1, n2 are the width and height of the current window. There are other graphics which can be applied to this line using setcolor().
